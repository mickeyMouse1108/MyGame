- High Priority (ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY)
  * [ ] `[TODO]` Add Tests for Geometry shaders
  * [ ] `[TODO]` [Bloom](https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-Lighting/Bloom)
  * [ ] `[TODO]` [Advanced Lighting](https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-Lighting/Bloom)
  * [ ] `[TODO]` [PBR](https://learnopengl.com/PBR/Theory)
  * [ ] `[TODO]` High Level (abstracted) Rendering
- Medium Priority (Feature is needed)
  * [ ] `[FIXME]` Fix Rich Text Parsing
  * [ ] `[TODO]` Add Geometry sdahader support
  * [ ] `[TODO]` Add Anti-aliasing
  * [ ] `[TODO]` Particle System
  * [ ] `[TODO]` Physics Engine
  * [ ] `[TODO]` Real-time editing (shaders?)
- Low Priority (Would be nice to have)
  * [ ] `[TODO]` Add Instancing
  * [ ] `[TODO]` Custom GUI
- Misc (I have no idea)
- Done (Finished!)
  * [X] ~~`[DONE]` Make Matrix Variations `matrix<N, M, T>`~~
  * [X] ~~`[DONE]` Make Vector share same class `vecn<N, T>` (and use less macros)~~
  * [X] ~~`[DONE]` Add Easy Shader Args~~
  * [X] ~~`[DONE]` Add Easy Vertex Conversion~~
  * [X] ~~`[DONE]` Integrate `post_build.bat` to CMake~~
